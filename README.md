Community Discussions
=====================

Community Discussions is an OpenPlans experiment in place-based online discussions as a tool for democratizing the planning process. Everyone has an idea for how they want their community to change and grow, but not everyone has the time or patience for the traditional planning process. We hope this is a step towards using the scale of the web bring more voices into planning.
